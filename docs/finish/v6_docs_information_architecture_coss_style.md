# v6 Documentation Information Architecture + COSS Style

## Summary

This update introduces a professional documentation structure and modern COSS-style landing presentation for core Markdown surfaces.

## Implemented

- Added documentation IA:
  - `docs/architecture/`
  - `docs/api/`
  - `docs/manual/`
- Added technical docs:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added ADR for storage decision:
  - `docs/architecture/ADR-0001-storage-engine-sqlite.md`
- Added new guides:
  - `docs/api/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
  - `docs/manual/USER_GUIDE.md`
- Added docs index:
  - `docs/README.md`
- Added adaptive brand assets:
  - `docs/assets/brand/oriondesk-mark-light.svg`
  - `docs/assets/brand/oriondesk-mark-dark.svg`
- Updated landing pages with Hybrid HTML + Markdown and card-based navigation:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Notes

- On Windows repositories, file casing for `ROADMAP.md` and `roadmap.md` is equivalent; canonical roadmap file remains `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
